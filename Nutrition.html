<h1>Nutrition</h1> 
<p1>Eating well is essential to living a good life. The dieting culture has confused the public as to what healthy food is and how to manage weight loss. There is no right weight for everybody. Weight is determined by genetics, body type, and fat to mass ratio. 

Healthy diet consists of low fat, abundance of vegetables and fruits, and limiting or avoidance of processed foods. Based on most studies, a low carb diet can work for some people and low fat diet works for most people.

Controlling and even ending emotional eating is necessary.
